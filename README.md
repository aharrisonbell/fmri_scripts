# MRI_TOOLZ

This repository contains a number of scripts and wrappers useful for batch preprocessing and simple analysis of MRI data, including functional (FMRI) data and DTI datasets.

The scripts are written in Bash/tsch but require installation of AFNI, SPM, and/or FSL.

These scripts were used to prepare data and figures for the following manuscripts:

Bell et al., 2008 J Neurophysiol
Bell et al., 2011 J Neurosci
Rafal et al., 2015 J Neurophysiol
Bell et al., 2016 Curr Biol
Ainsworth et al., 2018 Neuropsychologia
